# etch-a-sketch

This project is part of The Odin Project.

Purpose it to review the html, css and javascript skills I've learnt in previous lessons and apply them onto a hands-on project.

TODO: come back and complete 'extra credit' session:
Instead of just changing the color of a square from black to white (for example), have each pass through with the mouse change it to a completely random RGB value. Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black.
